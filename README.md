## README

This README provides an overview and usage instructions for the code included in this repository.

### Introduction
The code in this repository is designed to facilitate the downloading of files from various sources, including YouTube videos and other URLs. It leverages the `tqdm`, `requests`, `pytube`, and `os` libraries to achieve this functionality.

### Prerequisites
To run the code, please ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python 3.x
- The `tqdm`, `requests`, `pytube`, and `os` libraries

### Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the code in a Python editor or IDE.

### Usage
1. Mount your Google Drive by running `drive.mount('/content/drive')`.
2. Define the destination folder in your Google Drive where the downloaded files will be saved. Modify the `destination_folder` variable to specify the desired folder path.
3. If the destination folder doesn't exist, the code will create it automatically.
4. Use the `download_youtube_video()` function to download YouTube videos. Pass the YouTube video URL and the destination folder path as arguments to the function.
5. If the input is not a YouTube link, the code will attempt to download the file from the provided URL. Make sure the URL is accessible and the file exists.
6. The code will display the file size and progress bar while downloading the file.
7. Once the file is downloaded, it will be saved in the specified destination folder.
8. Repeat the process for downloading additional files by entering new URLs or YouTube links.
9. To exit the program, enter 'exit' when prompted for a download link.

### Example
Here is an example usage of the code:

1. Mount your Google Drive:
```python
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

2. Define the destination folder in your Google Drive:
```python
destination_folder = '/content/drive/MyDrive/DOWNLOADS 02/'
```

3. Run the code and follow the prompts to enter a download link or YouTube URL. For example:
```python
Enter the download link (or 'exit' to quit): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcde12345
```

4. Monitor the progress bar as the file downloads. Once completed, the file will be saved in the specified destination folder.

### Note
- Ensure that you have a stable internet connection while running the code, especially when downloading large files or streaming YouTube videos.
